Ideas:

plot all data - train model to see if this is linear or not

Pattern recognition as CNN?

log transformation? 

Linear range - points out of the range will get smaller weights


Next meeting 7.11.23 at 17.15. Things to achieve by next meeting:
1) Plot all the graphs to get to know the data; think of data preprocessing
2) Think of potential algorithms that could be apply to solve the problem
