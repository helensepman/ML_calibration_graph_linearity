How to determine which points within a linear regression graph are not linear?
How to implement RF for this? What is "approximately" the same RF? How similar is similar enough? How to measure the similarity?

Treat it as a classification problem - to start. I think this is the bottleneck. If we have this classification task solved, then calculating the slope is an easy task? 


We should use other evaluation metrics? we can start with accuracy, and then for the better models do like confusion matrix, f1-score, TPR and FPR?

Should we have another meeting with Anneli? What is our test data? 
I am slightly worried that we now train model based on all datapoints, but in reality it should be compound & lab based? Don't know how this can be done though...
